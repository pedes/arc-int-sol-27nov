1. **Broken Object-Level Authorization (BOLA):**
   - Use proper authentication mechanisms (OAuth, JWT) to ensure only authorized users access the API.
   - Implement fine-grained access controls and enforce proper authorization at the object level.
   - Regularly review and update access control policies.

2. **Data Exposure:**
   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit using secure protocols (HTTPS).
   - Implement encryption for sensitive data at rest.
   - Avoid exposing unnecessary data and limit the information returned by the API.

3. **Broken Authentication:**
   - Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication.
   - Enforce secure session management practices.
   - Regularly test and validate authentication mechanisms.

4. **Excessive Data Exposure:**
   - Minimize the amount of data returned by the API to only what is necessary.
   - Implement proper input validation and output encoding to prevent data leakage.
   - Regularly audit and review data exposure risks.

5. **Security Misconfiguration:**
   - Follow secure coding practices and MuleSoft best practices.
   - Regularly audit and review the configuration settings for the API.
   - Remove default configurations and unnecessary services.
   - Restrict permissions to the minimum required for users and services.

6. **Injection:**
   - Use parameterized queries and prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
   - Validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
   - Employ content security policies to mitigate injection risks in response content.

7. **Improper Assets Management:**
   - Safely manage API keys, credentials, and tokens using secure vaults.
   - Rotate API keys and credentials regularly.
   - Implement proper access controls for sensitive assets.

8. **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Enable comprehensive logging of security-relevant events.
   - Implement real-time monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities.
   - Regularly review logs and conduct security incident response drills.

9. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**
   - Implement proper access controls to prevent unauthorized access to objects.
   - Validate user input to ensure it does not manipulate object references.

10. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    - Implement output encoding to prevent XSS attacks in response content.
    - Sanitize user inputs to remove malicious scripts.
    - Use security headers, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), to mitigate XSS risks.
